## Description
The mod adds a layer of security on top of the already existing "Security". You have to perform a hack in order to unlock the vehicle, failing the hack will trigger a police response.

Certain vehicles (especially richer ones) do have a stronger security system : If you fail twice the hack, the security will be reinforced, blocking the possibility to hack them again
## Pre 2.0 Patch
#### Since 2.0 Patch, CDPR added Quickhacks for vehicles, along with a full rework of the police system ; These major changes makes some features on this list outdated !

#### Outdated features are marked as the following : "(*Pre 2.0 Patch*)"

(*Pre 2.0 Patch*) (Optional) Added support for [Vehicle Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3815) mod : If you fail a hack, members from the hacked vehicle's faction will appear (*e.g : If you try and fail to hack an Arasaka-marked vehicle, Arasaka members will come against you*).
Unaffiliated vehicles will spawn NCPD vehicles. To activate the support, make sure to enable "Vehicle Combat Compatibility" in game (via Mod Settings)

## Quickhacks
The mod also adds quickhacks for vehicles :
 - Unlock Vehicle
 
    > Similar to the Remote Breach quickhack, this will open the hacking minigame panel. There is however a usage cooldown
 - Auto Unlock
 
    > Automatically unlocks the vehicle after a couple seconds. High RAM usage
 - Distract
 
    > Distracts nearby enemies for a short time
 - (*Pre 2.0 Patch*) Force Brakes
 
 	  > Forces Brakes for 10 Seconds (*May not always work paired with Reckless Driving*)
 - (*Pre 2.0 Patch*) Explode
 
 	  > Blows up the Vehicle. You won't get chased by the police if you blow up a vehicle with a civilian inside
 - Reckless Driving
 
 	  > Forces the Vehicle to start driving recklessly (ONE TIME USE ONLY) (*May also not work sometimes when paired with Force Brakes*)       

Vehicles owned by the player are unlocked by default and cannot get quickhacked
