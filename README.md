## Description
The mod adds a layer of security on top of the already existing "Security". You have to perform a hack in order to unlock the vehicle, failing the hack will trigger a police response.

Certain vehicles (especially richer ones) do have a stronger security system : If you fail twice the hack, the security will be reinforced, blocking the possibility to hack them again

The mod also adds quickhacks for vehicles :
 - Unlock Vehicle
 
    > Similar to the Remote Breach quickhack, this will open the hacking minigame panel. There is however a usage cooldown
 - Distract
 
    > Distracts nearby enemies for a short time
 - Force Brakes
 
 	  > Forces Brakes for 10 Seconds
 - Explode
 
 	  > Blows up the Vehicle. You won't get chased by the police if you blow up a vehicle with a civilian inside

Vehicles owned by the player are unlocked by default and cannot get quickhacked
